This repo holds supporting documentation for my proposals submitted to the Sneed DAO SNS. This readme file will index into active and previous proposals.

There have been no proposals submitted so far. Currently proposals are being prepared for the XB0 proposal group to manage the process for moving Sonic LP to ICPSwap.
