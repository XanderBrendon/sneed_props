This repo holds supporting documentation for proposals submitted to the Sneed DAO SNS (specifically proposals by me, but the community is encouraged to utilize the space to track and support proposals they submit as well). This readme file will index into active and previous proposals tracked by this repo. Contributors are expected to keep the index up to date as they work on proposals.
