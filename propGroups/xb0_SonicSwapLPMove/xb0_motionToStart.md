Sneed Diamond Club members have expressed interest in discord chat at the idea of moving Sneed/ICP tokens that are in Sonic liquidity pools out of Sonic and into ICPSwap liquidity pools. This XB0 proposal group aims to map out a plan to execute on this idea in a responsible way that grants Sneed voters the opportunity to provide informed input along the way.

The XB0 section of this repository will contain supporting research methodology for data provided so that voters can reproduce and verify results as well as individual documents for shorter reading for individual proposals along the way.

The proposal group is broken down into many individual steps to try and make the process understandable and take a cautious approach to execution to avoid any risk of lost DAO funds. The more detailed documentation provided here is meant to share learning experiences from a new member of the ICP/Sneed community trying to demonstrate responsible participation in the ecosystem.

The stages of XB0 are outlined in [xb0_stages.md](xb0_stages.md)

This motion proposal is for the community to decide if the plan of action laid out here should be executed on as planned through stage 1 of the outlined process.
