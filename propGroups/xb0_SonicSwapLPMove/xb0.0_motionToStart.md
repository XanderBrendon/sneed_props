# Motion Proposal to Begin Execution of XB0 Stage 1

## What is it?
Sneed Diamond Club members have expressed interest in discord chat at the idea of moving Sneed/ICP tokens that are in Sonic liquidity pools out of Sonic and into ICPSwap liquidity pools. Because this is a multistep process, the goal will be collected under a series of proposals referred to here as XB0 for ease of reference. Stage 1 involves claiming fees from the Sonic LP pool and withdrawing them to prove capability of interacting with the pool.

## How is it happening?
This XB0 proposal group aims to map out a plan to execute on this idea in a responsible way that grants Sneed voters the opportunity to provide informed input along the way.

The XB0 section of this repository will contain supporting research methodology for data provided so that voters can reproduce and verify results as well as individual documents for shorter reading for individual proposals along the way.

The proposal group is broken down into many individual steps to try and make the process understandable and take a cautious approach to execution to avoid any risk of lost DAO funds. The more detailed documentation provided here is meant to share learning experiences from a new member of the ICP/Sneed community trying to demonstrate responsible participation in the ecosystem.

The stages of XB0 are outlined in the [Stages (xb0_stages.md)](xb0_stages.md) file. Sneed voters are encouraged to read into these more detailed files to understand upcoming proposals, help us catch any mistakes early, provide feedback and ideas, and help us proceed with this plan in a timely manner (assuming community consensus).

## Got any more details?
The reasearch and learning folder under this proposal group has some results and instructions for validating my investigations into the [sonic canisters](/propGroups/xb0_SonicSwapLPMove/research_and_learning/sonic_canisters.md). All the steps and correct parameters to be passed everywhere are still being mapped out, so this repo will evolve as we figure more details out and advance through the work.

## What is my vote right now is deciding?
This motion proposal is for the community to decide if the plan of action laid out here should be executed on as planned through stage 1 of the outlined process (for the DAO to claim fees earned from the Sonic LP pool).

Please vote Yes to Proceed with Stage 1 or vote No if you prefer for the DAO to not attempt to claim Sonic LP fees. Feedback is welcomed via Discord or the preferred method of participating in [Discussions in this github project](https://github.com/XanderBrendon/sneed_props/discussions) for better record keeping.
